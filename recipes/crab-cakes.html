<h3>Crab Cake Description:</h3>
<b><p>A crab cake is a variety of fishcake popular in the United States. It is composed of crab meat and various other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, mayonnaise, mustard (typically prepared mustard, but sometimes mustard powder), eggs, and seasonings. It is then sautéed, baked, grilled, deep fried, or broiled.</p></b>


<h4>Ingredients List:</h4>
<b><p><ol><li>Crab meat-
  Traditionally made with jumbo lump crab meat, but you can also use flaky crab meat from the rest of the crab. Using both types of meat creates a better consistency.</li>
<li>Eggs and mayonnaise-
  These bind the crab meat together. </li>
  <li>Breadcrumbs-
    Panko-style breadcrumbs are coarser than Italian breadcrumbs and work well in crab cakes. </li>
<li>Seasonings
  Common seasonings include celery salt, red and black pepper, Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. You can also add mustard, Worcestershire sauce, or hot sauce. </li>
</ol></p>

<h5>Steps to making crab cakes:</h5>
<b><p><ol><li>Prepare the crab meat-Remove any shell pieces from the crab meat and gently fold it into a bowl with other ingredients. You can use lump crab meat, which is more affordable and works well for crab cakes. The goal is to keep the crab meat in large chunks.</li>
  <li>Add binding ingredients-Mix in an egg and breadcrumbs to bind the crab meat together. The egg's protein and liquid act as a glue, while the breadcrumbs absorb excess liquid. You can also add mayonnaise to add moisture.</li>
<li> Add other ingredients-Season with Old Bay seasoning, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, or other seasonings. You can also add chopped fresh parsley for color and freshness. If you want to add vegetables, you can finely mince red, green, orange, or yellow bell pepper and blend it into the mixture.</li>
<li>Form the crab cakes-Mix everything together by hand, being careful not to overwork the crab meat. Form the mixture into patties.</li>
<li>Cook the crab cakes-You can bake, broil, pan-fry, grill, or deep fry the crab cakes. Pan-frying in neutral oil can produce a crunchy crust.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>You can also refrigerate the mixture for at least 30 minutes and up to a full day to help the crab cakes hold together.</p>
